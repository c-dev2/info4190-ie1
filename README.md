# Reverse-String

## Description
This is a script written in PowerShell to reverse any given string of text. For example, it would take the word 'palindrome' and return 'emordnilap'.

## How to Use

To run this script, simply open a PowerShell window and enter the path to this script.

Once it is running, it will first ask if you wish to reverse the text from a file you have or if you want to directly enter some text for it to reverse. Enter the corresponding number for the choice you want.

If you want to reverse the contents of a file, when it prompts you, enter in the full path to the file without quotation marks (even if there is a space). Currently, this script only supports reversing CSVs and text documents.

If you want to type some text into the CLI for the script to reverse, just type in the text once it asks you to, then hit 'Enter'.

In either case, the script will output the results of the reversal to the terminal.
